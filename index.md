# Projects Portifolio

Welcome to my portfolio of printed circuit boards! 

Here, I proudly present a selection of the PCBs I have meticulously designed over the past few years. The majority of these boards are integral components of projects that I worked on during my tenure as a member of the esteemed research and outreach group, Zenith EESC-USP. Each PCB showcased here represents a culmination of dedication, innovation, and technical expertise, reflecting my commitment to pushing the boundaries of electronic design. I invite you to explore this collection and witness the exciting journey of my contributions to the world of PCB development within the realm of Zenith EESC-USP.

## London Power - EPS
This was the power board project of the nano-satellite USPSat-I. It is responsible for implementing the battery charging circuits using the energy generated by the solar panels, using an MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) to achieve maximum efficiency. Additionally, this board was also responsible for converting voltage levels for the other subsystems through the use of switched-mode converters.

## Varella Logical - EPS
This board played a critical role in the mission as it integrated the entire power system of the CubeSat USPSat-I. It handled all the instrumentation and control of the EPS (Electrical Power System) using an STM32 microcontroller. Being dependent on this board, all the other satellite systems relied on its flawless performance.

## Ribatski Module Board - EPS

This module was responsible for the coupling of the batteries to the power system of the CubeSat USPSat-I. Additionally, on this board, the circuits for the active thermal control of the project were implemented, which were being controlled through the bus by the Varela Logical EPS board.

## Main Board Lite

This board was the first prototype of the Genus project, which aims to create a generic hardware platform for aerospace applications. This version, called the main board lite, is designed to integrate two other systems through a standardized bus, capable of implementing redundant communication protocols such as CAN, I2C, and SPI. Additionally, it features switched-mode circuits for power conversion and system power supply.

## Main Board STD
This board is a prototype of the Genus project, specifically the main board standard version, which aims to integrate various other systems through a standardized bus. This bus is capable of implementing redundant communication protocols such as CAN, I2C, and SPI, as well as different generic buses that can be customized according to the mission's needs. Additionally, it features switched-mode circuits for power conversion and system power supply.

## Power Control System 
This board was developed during my scientific initiation project to serve as a control system for conducting tests on UPS batteries to determine their SOC (State of Charge) and SOH (State of Health). It features a control system based on STM32, as well as a secondary microcontroller for managing serial communication and Bluetooth with external devices. The board includes switched-mode circuits for power conversion and charging a backup battery, providing power for the monitoring system during electrical grid outages.

##  Hardware Assembly

During the execution of these projects, I had the opportunity to actively participate in the Hardware Assembly process, gaining valuable hands-on experience with manual soldering of Surface Mount Devices (SMD) components. Additionally, I was involved in conducting thorough inspection, testing, and validation procedures to ensure the quality and functionality of the assembled hardware.
